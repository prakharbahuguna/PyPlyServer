# PyPlyServer

A music jukebox server that allows party-goers to add songs to a party playlist and vote up songs via SMS. Users can also hear a 30 second preview via a phone call. The server integrates with the [PyPly](https://github.com/prakharbahuguna/PyPly) client which responds to the server's commands.

This project was developed for the [Great Uni Hack 2015](http://greatunihack.co.uk/).
